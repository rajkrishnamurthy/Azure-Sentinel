## Review and Manage Data Table Retention
**Authors : Matt Lowe; Sreedhar Ande**

With the introduction of the new Search, Archive, and Restoration features within Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Log Analytics, it is imperative that the retention on tables with the workspace is monitored. To make this process easier, this tool has been developed within Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks. This tool allows users to perform the following:
- Identify tables within the workspace.
- Identify search tables that have been generated within the workspace.
- Retention set for the table within the workspace
- Retention set for archiving.
- Total retention of the data in both the worksapce and in archive.
- Update retention for the data in the workspace and archive.
